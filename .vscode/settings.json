/* =========================================================================
  VS CODE WORKSPACE SETTINGS (settings.json)

  These settings are specific to the Visual Studio Code editor (IDE)
  and do NOT affect the compilation, build, or deployment of the project.

  Their primary purpose is to enhance the development experience (DX)
  within this specific IDE instance.
  =========================================================================

  files.associations: { ... }
    Defines language associations for specific file names or extensions.

    "*.json": "jsonc"
      Treats all generic JSON files as JSON with Comments (JSONC).

    "tsconfig.json": "jsonc"
    "tsconfig.app.json": "jsonc"
      Forces TypeScript configuration files to be treated as JSONC.
      This is necessary to allow comments (e.g., documentation) within
      these files without VS Code signaling a syntax error.
